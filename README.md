**What I have gained:** (◍•ᴗ•◍)ゝ

Through this project, I have a deep understanding in the *5 stages of design thinking*:

- **Empathize:** I learnt how to understand users' needs through research and observation.

- **Define:** I can identify and express the problems and challenges clearly.

- **Ideate:** I practiced brainstorming and exploring creative and innovative ideas with team members.

- **Prototype:** I learnt how to create simple models of our ideas to test the possibilities and gather feedback.

- **Test:** I understood the importance of repetition by testing, identifying weaknesses and clarifying our ideas based on feedback.

**My improvement:** ٩(๑•̀ω•́๑)۶

I was able to collaborate with others I was not familiar with. I gained experience in sharing experiences and leveraging each team member's strengths and weaknesses. Besides that, I can communicate for example in brainstorming sessions, making videos and presentations. Moreover,  I worked with other team members to develop solutions that focused on end-user needs as well as explored ideas and apply the most promising ones in ideate phase.

Furthermore, I have improved my ability to record the design thinking process. I was able to present information in a structured format. In addition, I can create a fascinating description for our group project, edit visuals, and deliver engaging content through a video. In the presentation, I learnt how to summarize ideas and present them using slides and graphics to enhance the presentation.
